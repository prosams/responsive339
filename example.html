      <h1>Example Entries</h1>

      <h2>These are all from my most recent journals from the past two years!</h2>

        <div class="container">
          <div>
          <img src="images/exletter.jpg" alt="calligraphy letters">
          <!-- exletter.jpg -->
          <p>I made this page when I wanted to dip my toes into calligraphy. It's not exactly super fancy script, but I (personally) think it looks cool. It was also a great way to destress — all I had to do was write some letters over and over.</p>
          </div>

          <div>
          <!-- excollage.JPG -->
          <img src="images/excollage.JPG" alt="collage paris tickets">
          <p>This page has some souvenirs from when I travelled to France. Keeping ticket stubs is a little cliche, but if you never show anyone your journal, who's to judge? I also sometimes like to tape receipts into my journals. They're one of those things that are unbelievably common, but carry a lot of information (purchasing habits, etc) and are interesting to have in 10 years.</p>
          </div>

          <div>
          <!-- excollage2.jpg -->
          <img src="images/excollage2.jpg" alt="perfume samples">
          <p>These cards are the ones that they give out as perfume samples. I liked how they looked (and now my journal sort of smells like the perfume!).</p>
          </div>

          <div>
          <!-- extape.JPG -->
          <img src="images/extape.JPG" alt="tape imprint">
          <p>One of my favorite things about journaling is that you can put whatever you want in it. This is from a used book I bought—there was a piece of tape on the inside and when I peeled it off, it left an imprint of the text. Doesn't really serve any practical purpose or meaning other than looking cool.</p>
          </div>

          <div><!-- exdraw.JPG -->
          <img src="images/exdraw.JPG" alt="sad watercolor frog">
          <p>I don't consider myself to be all that artistic, but sometimes I'm in the mood for some drawing. Here's a frog I whipped up when I was feeling especially down.</p>
          </div>

          <div>
          <!-- exentry.jpg -->
          <img src="images/exentry.jpg" alt="perfume page entry">
          <p>Here's a perfume page I have tabbed! Not everything I write is as neat as this (some might not even consider this neat) but it's an example of a page that I like looking back on for organizational purposes.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
      <p>There's a lot of random things in my journal. I hope these encouraged you to try something new!</p>
