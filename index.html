        <h1>A Little About Me</h1>
          <p>I've been journaling for around 13 years. Even back when I was seven years old (and started every entry with "Dear Di,") journaling was a way for me to better understand myself and my connection to the world around me. Since then, it's also become a planner, a portable inspiration corner, and a space for me to reflect on personal growth, challenges, and changes in my life.</p>

          <p>I love the open ended-ness of journaling. The ambiguity of writing lends itself to millions of content possibilities, all of which depend on the creator, who has the ultimate power to decide what they want to make. My journal is one of the few things in my life that I consider a true extension of me. There's no other setting where I feel more comfortable complaining about a bad day, talking about something I've accomplished, or simply copying down the events of my day. I also love that in the end, I have a book that I've brought to life — a very physical representation of how I have evolved over a period of time. In a world that's becoming increasingly digital, sometimes the mere act of putting a pen to paper is a sacrement.</p>

          <p>Journaling doesn't have to be about creativity. Not everyone likes creative writing and that's perfectly okay. But I think everyone can gain something simply by taking the time to note the little (or big!) things happening in their lives. In 10 years, you're not going to remember everything you used to care about or even what your biggest fear used to be. It never hurts to preserve a snapshot of who you were — if anything, the contrast between the past and present makes our evolutions of self even more significant.</p>

          <p>Continue browsing for my own Journaling process — some of my favorite journaling materials, example pages from my own journals, and some prompt ideas if you're looking to start your own journal.</p>
